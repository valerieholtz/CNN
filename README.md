- Build a CNN from scratch using Fashion MNIST dataset (https://githubhelp.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)


- Train a CNN on the CatsvsDogs dataset (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cats_vs_dogs). Artificially minimize the data, try out and compare different approaches to work with small datasets:
 - CNN: Baseline model from scratch
 - Data Augmentation
 - Dropout
 - Transfer Learning
  - VGG19
  - InceptionResNetV2
  - MobileNetV2
  - NASNetMobile
